# CS382-SpaceSCHMUP
Project 3 for CS382-001-202435

For this project, I added an Asteroid component. In addition to the enemies, asteroids will spawn in that do not harm the player or the enemies, but they provide an added obstacle of trying to see around them. This makes the game more fun for the player as it adds a confusing element, leaving the player to guess whether or not the asteroid will harm them, and it provides another asset for the player to consider whilst playing.
